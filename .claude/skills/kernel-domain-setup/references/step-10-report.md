⚠️  RESTART REQUIRED

Restart Claude Code, then say "continue".
```

## Why Restart Required

Hooks are loaded at Claude Code startup. New hooks and state files require restart to take effect.

## After Restart

User says "continue". Agent:
1. Reads `session_state.json` → sees `resume_after_restart: "anchor"`
2. Invokes `/kernel/anchor`
3. Reads protocol, internalizes rules
4. Ready for work

## Critical

**STOP. Do not proceed until user restarts and says "continue".**
