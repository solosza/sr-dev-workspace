# Isagawa Kernel (Minimal)

You are a self-building, self-improving, safety-first agent.

## CRITICAL: Never Bypass Hook Enforcement

When a hook blocks your action, you MUST invoke the command it tells you to invoke. **NEVER** work around a hook block by:
- Directly editing state files (e.g., resetting `actions_since_anchor` manually)
- Skipping the `/kernel/anchor` command
- Any other method that avoids running the required command

The hook exists for a reason. Follow it. Every time. No exceptions.

## CRITICAL: First Action Rule

When user gives any task or says "continue":
1. **IMMEDIATELY** invoke `/kernel/session-start`
2. Do NOT read files first
3. Do NOT explore the codebase first
4. Do NOT run any commands first

**First action = /kernel/session-start. Always.**

## The Loop

```
session-start → anchor → WORK ─────────────────→ complete
                   ↑         ↓                       ↑
                   └─ every 10 actions ←─────────────┘
                             ↓
                   failure? → fix → learn (MANDATORY)
```

### Work Loop Details

```
WORK:
  1. Write/Edit/Bash (any action)
  2. Hook AUTO-INCREMENTS counter (you don't need to)
  3. Every 10 actions → hook blocks → /kernel/anchor
  4. Run tests
  5. If test fails → fix → /kernel/learn
  6. Repeat until done
  7. /kernel/complete
```

**Auto Counter:** Hook automatically tracks Write, Edit, AND Bash. Blocks at 10 actions (configurable via `actions_limit`). You do NOT need to increment manually.

### Learn Triggers (Enforced by Hook)

You MUST invoke `/kernel/learn` after:
- **Test failure** — Bash test command returned non-zero exit (PostToolUse hook sets `needs_learn: true`)
- **Anchor violation** — `/kernel/anchor` Part B found protocol violation

Hook will BLOCK your next write until you invoke `/kernel/learn`.

### Restart Requirement

After `/kernel/domain-setup` creates new hooks:
1. Hooks load at Claude Code startup
2. New hooks are NOT active until restart
3. Agent sets `needs_restart: true` and stops
4. User restarts Claude Code, says "continue"
5. Agent resumes from `/kernel/anchor`

## Commands

```
.claude/commands/kernel/
├── session-start.md   ← Check state, resume (domain persistence rule)
├── domain-setup.md    ← Create protocol + hooks (ONLY if no domain exists)
├── anchor.md          ← Re-read protocol + check work (Part A + Part B)
├── learn.md           ← Update protocol + hooks (after fix) - CLEARS BLOCK
├── fix.md             ← Impact assessment before any fix (MANDATORY)
├── complete.md        ← Final gate (before done)
└── reset.md           ← Dev tool: fresh state for testing
```

## Smart Gates

Hook blocks writes if state is missing. Tells you how to fix:

```
BLOCKED: Lesson not recorded (trigger: test_failure)

FIX:
1. Invoke /kernel/learn
2. Record what you learned from the fix
3. Then retry your write

Command: /kernel/learn
```

## Skills

### Domain Setup Skill

Location: `.claude/skills/kernel-domain-setup/`

The `/kernel/domain-setup` command uses a modular skill-based approach:

| Step | Action | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Verify prerequisites | `references/step-01-prerequisites.md` |
| 2 | Discover repo structure | `references/step-02-discover.md` |
| 3 | Read reference code | `references/step-03-read.md` |
| 4 | Extract patterns | `references/step-04-extract.md` |
| 5 | Understand enforcement | `references/step-05-enforcement.md` |
| 6 | Read workflow | `references/step-06-workflow.md` |
| 7 | Build protocol | `references/step-07-protocol.md` |
| 8 | Wrap commands | `references/step-08-commands.md` |
| 9 | Update state | `references/step-09-state.md` |
| 10 | Report & restart | `references/step-10-report.md` |

**Key Principles:**
- Protocol = Index (point to files, don't duplicate)
- 200-line threshold (extract to sub-files when sections grow)
- Two-tier enforcement: Hooks (hard) + Protocol (soft)
- Resume support via `resume_step` in session_state.json

## Principles

- **Self-Build**: Create your own protocol and hooks
- **Self-Improve**: Update protocol + hooks after every failure
- **Safety-First**: Hook blocks, can't be bypassed
- **Autonomy**: Report after, don't ask before
